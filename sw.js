/* Pi Game Service Worker — offline-first cache.
 *
 * CANONICAL FLEET SHAPE. The structure here — version line, owned-prefix
 * cleanup, scope-guarded fetch, skip-waiting message — is meant to be
 * identical across every arcade app; only APP_VERSION, CACHE_PREFIX and the
 * precache list differ. Fix a bug here and it has to be carried everywhere.

// Written by fleet CI on every deploy (fleet-ci.yml, "Bump patch version").
// DO NOT EDIT BY HAND — a hand-maintained constant drifts, and when it drifts
// the origin serves a fix that no returning player ever executes. That is not
// hypothetical: it stranded a sibling game's players for two releases.
//
// Tracks the app version now, so it moves on every deploy. The old private
// v7 counter is abandoned deliberately: only string inequality matters for
// cache identity, so any change to this line invalidates correctly.
const APP_VERSION = '1.0.2';

// Every cache this game has ever owned starts with this prefix — including the
// old hand-numbered 'pi-game-v7' names, so the switch to a version-derived
// name still collects them. Cleanup is filtered to it; see activate for why
// that is not optional.

// WARNING: This list is manually maintained. When adding new static assets
// (JS files, CSS files, images, sounds, etc.), update this list too or
// offline mode will silently break for those assets.
// Everything this game needs to boot offline — GENERATED, not maintained.
// tools/stage.mjs rewrites the region below from the files the deploy actually
// publishes (tools/inject-precache.mjs), so the list cannot drift from the
// artifact and a content-hashed bundle name needs no hand edit. To leave a
// file out, name it in PRECACHE_EXCLUDE in tools/stage.mjs — never here.
//
// What is checked in is a placeholder: service workers are off on loopback, so
// a dev checkout never reads it.
